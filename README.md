### What I learned

One of the most crucial aspects of coding is time management. When creating a project, you don't have to finish it right away in order to show it off. It depends on the scope of your project. Depending on the scope of your project, months of coding may be required.
However, with the assistance of inspirations, patience is essential. The animations are the most difficult and exciting element of this project for me. I believe animations are the most glamorous things on the internet, and I've been struggling to understand somehow. However, I believe I was able to complete my project effectively.
